# Welcome to Flarbs!

Flarbs is an [Arch GNU/Linux](https://archlinux.org/) post-install
script severely inspired by [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz/) by [Luke
Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/).\
\
The purpose of these scripts is to speed up the installation of my
personalized system setup, but decided to make it publicly available in
case someone else finds them useful.\
\
If you find any errors or have ideas for improvements, as I'm sure there could be many, please feel free to make a pull request.

## Installation

Read through the files carefully before you decide to run
them, then clone the files in your Arch GNU/Linux terminal emulator
using:\
\
`git clone https://github.com/flexbusterman/flarbs.git;`\
`cd flarbs;`\
`sudo chmod +x flarbsinstall;`\
`./flarbsinstall;`
